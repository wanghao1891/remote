* [Which is the best MongoDB GUI?](http://blog.mongodirector.com/which-is-the-best-mongodb-gui/)

  A good UI is an important part of the development experience. The mongo shell works great for administrative actions but when working with larger amounts of data, the UI becomes fairly important. There are a number of options when it comes to MongoDB GUI, some good and some not so good. Our customers regularly ask us which UI we recommend – below are some of the options for MongoDB UI we have considered. Our main scenarios are data visualization, presentation and editing. As always your mileage might vary depending on your scenario and preferences.
